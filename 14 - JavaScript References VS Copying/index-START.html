    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.

    // // You might think we can just do something like this:
    // const team = players
    // console.log(players, team)
    // // however what happens when we update that array?
    // team[3] = 'Charlie'
    // // now here is the problem!
    // console.log(players, team)

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    // const team = players.slice()
    // console.log(players, team)
    // team[3] = 'Charlie'
    // console.log(players, team)
    
    // one way
    
    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    // const team = [].concat(players)
    // console.log(players, team)
    // team[3] = 'Charlie'
    // console.log(players, team)

    // or use the new ES6 Spread - Fave :)
    const team = [...players]
    console.log(players, team)
    team[3] = 'Charlie'
    console.log(players, team)
    console.clear()
    // const team = Array.from(players)
    // console.log(players, team)
    // team[3] = 'Charlie'
    // console.log(players, team)

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    // const copy = person

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const copy = Object.assign({}, person, {location: 'Boston'})
    console.log(person, copy)
    copy.age = 99
    console.log(person, copy)
    console.clear();
    
    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    // const spread = {...person}

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
